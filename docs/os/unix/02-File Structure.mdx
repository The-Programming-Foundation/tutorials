title: Unix File Structure
---

The UNIX file structure is like an inverted tree and arranged in a hierarchical structure.

- The top-level of the directory is the root **/**. Root connects the path to other files and directories
- Each directory has a unique name. Each of them contains different kinds of files and directories

This is what the Unix file structure looks like:
