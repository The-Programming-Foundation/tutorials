## Introduction

You can print an output or statement in C. To enable this `#include <stdio.h>` header file that is specific for input and output behavior in C. The printf() can be used as below:

```c
// Hello Earth program

// C library that includes printf() function
#include <stdio.h>

// Main function
int main() {

  printf("Hello Earth");

  return 0;
}
```

**Output:**

```sh
Hello Earth
```

## Variables

C is **statically-typed** which means the programmer does have to declare the type of the variable when defining the variable. To declare a integer variable:

```c
int variable = 7;
```

Programs do have variables as the name to the storage area. These can be manipulated, has the size and layout of the variable’s memory. The names are a combination of letters, digits, and underscore characters. The compiler is specific of upper and lower characters and the name generally starts with underscore or letter.

```c
// Declaring a variable

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {

  // Declaring a integer variable which holds the number 7
  int variable = 7;

  return 0;
}
```

## Format specifier

The format specifiers in C are used to define the datatype for input and output.

- **%d** - is used for integers
- **%c** - is used for characters

```c
// Printing the variable

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {

  // Declaring a integer variable which holds the number 7
  int variable = 7;

  // Printing the variable using integer format specifier
  printf("%d", variable);

  return 0;
}
```

**Output:**

```sh
7
```

## New Line

To print a output in multiple lines, use **\n**:

```c
printf("Hello Earth\nYou are not as green as I expected\n");
```

**Output**:

```
Hello Earth
You are not as green as I expected
```

## Arrays

A fixed data structure that stores the same type of elements is called arrays. It is also the collection of the same elements. There is a single and multi-dimensional array. Arrays are widely used during programming for its easy access to elements across the dimension. The index of an array starts with **0**, so the first element is accessible using **[0]**.

To create an array without defining the size:

```c
int arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4};
```

To define the size of the array:

```c
int arr[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
```

To print the first element of this array:

```c
printf("%d", arr[0]);
```

## Strings

A string is an array of characters. To define a string variable:

```c
char message[] = "Humans are smart";
```

:::note
The datatype here is a string of characters. Therefore, <b>char</b> is the
datatype.
