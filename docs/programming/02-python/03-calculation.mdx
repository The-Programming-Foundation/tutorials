## Expression

Like mathematical expression, python expression is the combination of numbers, values, string or any math operations. Expressions are the instructions of variables and operators to obtain a single value. An example of the expression in Python language is

```python
x = 7
y = 4
z = x + y
print(z)
```

**Output:**

```python
11
```

Python can do calculations.

## Addition

To add two numbers and print the result:

```python
>>> x = 10
>>> y = 4
>>> z = x + y
>>> print(z)
14
```

## Subtraction

To subtract two numbers and print the result:

```python
>>> x = 7
>>> y = 5
>>> z = x - y
>>> print(z)
2
```

## Multiplication

To multiply two numbers and print the result:

```python
>>> x = 8
>>> y = 5
>>> z = x * y
>>> print(z)
40
```

## Division

To divide two numbers and print the result:

```python
>>> x = 12
>>> y = 3
>>> z = x / y
>>> print(z)
4.0
```

## Exponent

The **\*\*** operator returns, **x** raised to the power of **y**. To calculate exponents:

```python
>>> x = 2
>>> y = 3
>>> z = x ** y
>>> print(z)
8
```
