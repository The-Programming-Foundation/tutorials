## String

Strings in python are the collection of characters. The characters in the string are declared in single or double-quotes.

```python
message = "Let the earth breathe"
```

## Printing a statement

To display Hello Earth in the Python shell:

```python
>>> print("Hello Earth")
```

To display a Hello Earth statement in a python script:

```python
print("Hello Earth")
```

## Variables

Variables are like containers. They either hold values or strings. Python is **dynamically-typed** which means the programmer doesn’t have to declare the datatype of the variable. The Python interpreter will automatically know the type of the variable.

To declare a variable named **x**:

```python
>>> x = 2
```

:::note
{" "}
Python has a built in method to check the datatype of a variable. The method is
called <b>type(name_of_variable)</b>
:::

To check the datatype of **x**:

```python
>>> type(x)
<class 'int'>
```

To declare a string:

```python
>>> message = "Humans are smart"
```

We can check the datatype of **message**:

```python
>>> type(message)
<class 'str'>
```

## New line

To print a output in multiple lines, use **\n**:

```python
>>> print("Earth is not green anymore\n", "Is this true?\n")
Earth is not green anymore
 Is this true?
```

## List

Python provides built-in lists and the basic one is a sequence. Each element in the sequence has its index. Modifying elements of a list is possible. To define a list:

```python
names = ["Bill", "Steve"]
print(names)
```

**Output:**

```python
['Bill', 'Steve']
```

## Tuples

Tuples are objects similar to the list. Unlike the list, it is immutable and therefore cannot be changed once created. There are multiple ways to create tuples. Tuple allows you to access, and append the tuples. Modifying or updating an existing tuple is not possible. You can create a new tuple and delete the old one. The index for tuple starts with ‘0’, which is similar to the list.

```python
companies = ("Microsoft", "Apple")
print(companies)
```

**Output:**

```python
('Microsoft', 'Apple')
```

## Dictionaries

In Python, dictionary is more of structured list. To define a dictionary:

```python
information = {"Name": "Bruce", "Company": "Wayne Industries"}
print(information["Name"])
```

**Output:**

```python
Bruce
```
