# Algorithm

### An algorithm is the set of instructions in steps to solve a problem.

In real-life if you had to count the number of members in a room, you would count one by one until you finish counting the last member.

So we count a member and add one to the previous counted number, go to next member, and repeat the same procedure until there are no members in the room. This is a step-wise procedure and that a normal person follows to count the members.

For a computer to solve a problem or perform a task for us, for example, a counting poblem, we give it a sequence of instructions similar to the step-bt-step procedure humans follow ourselves. An algorithm is a sequence of instructions given to computers to solve problems or perform tasks.

An algorithm can be written by a plain langugae, a pseudo-code or described by a diagram-representd flowchart and it can be implemented in different computer programming langugages. 

## Pseudo-code
Pseudo-codes are simplified version of computer programs and written in nantural language.

- Pseudo-code can be read and followed by programmers to write computer program.
- Pseudo-code does not have specific syntax and can't be excuted by a computer.
- Pseudo-code can be implemented in specific programming language.

for example, a pseudo-code of counting members is as follows:

num_members_far is set to be zero before counting
while the input of member name is not empty
    increment number_members_so_far by one
num_members_so_far is the total number of members at the end

## Flowchart
An algorithm can be described as a pictorial representation with different symbols, shapes, arrow that describes the different process. Each shape describes a different process:

- The process is represented graphically.
- The process is described block by block with the arrows between blocks indicating the order of workflow.
- The described steps are easy to follow.
- Cost less time and does not require the understanding of code.
 
for example, a flowchart of counting members is as follows:
        --------------------------------
        |    num_members_so_far = 0     |
        ---------------------------------
                      |
                      V
                      *
                    ******
                  **********                      otherwise
     ------->* while input name is not empty *-------------
     |            **********                              |
     |              *******                               |
     |                 *                                  |
     |                 |                                  |
     |                 V                                  |
     |    -------------------------------------------     |
     ----|   increment number_members_so_far by one |     |
         --------------------------------------------     |
                                                          |
                                                          |
                                                          V
         ---------------------------------------------------------
         |  output number_members_so_far as total_number_members |
         ----------------------------------------------------------

## Example of Python code implementation
For reference, the above pseudo-code or flowchart can be followed to write a Python code as follows:

number_members_so_far = 0
while (input("name? ") != ""):
     number_members_so_far += 1
print(number_members_so_far)

sample output of the above Python code:
name? Jack Lee
name? Mary Lo
name?
