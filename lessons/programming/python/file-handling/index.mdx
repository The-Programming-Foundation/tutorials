# File Handling
Python has built-in functions to perform operations on files, including reading and writing files.

To perform a file operation, first, a file has to be opened. Then the file operation can be performed. Files are closed afterwards.

## Opening a file
The built-in **open()** function opens and gaining access to a file. It accesses a file by the specified filename (in the current directory) or a path to that file. 
A mode can also be specified for different purposes as follows:

**'r'**: Opens the specified file for reading, and this is the default mode of operation. An error occurs if a file does not exist.<br />
**'w'**: Opens the specified file for writing. A new file will be created if it does not exist.<br />
**'a'**: Opens the specified file for appending. A new file will be created if it does not exist.<br />
**'x'**: Creates the specified file. An error occurs if the file exists.<br />


As another option, the file could be specified to be one of the two types of mode:

**t**: Text mode, and this is the default mode.<br />
**b**: Binary mode.<br />


## Reading a file

**read()**: read bytes as a string<br />
**readline()**: read a line in the file as a string<br />
**readlines()**: read all lines in the file as a list of strings (each line is a string)<br />

## Writing a file

**write(<a string is specified>)**: write a string as a line into the file.<br />
**writelines(<a list of strings is specified>)**: write multiple strings, each string as a line, into a file.<br />

## Closing a file
The Python function **close()** will free up the memory spaces used by the file.

### Read in a file and count the number of lines in it
For example, count how many records in a file named "records.txt" with the content: 
```Python
1. Jerry Smith, USA
2. Lily Tom, Canada
3. Peter Frank, France
4. Susan Yellen, USA
5. David Elli, Japan
```

It is first opened by open(), then each line is read in and counted at a time; after all lines are read in and counted, the file is closed, and the number of lines is displayed. 
```Python 
# opens records.txt in the current directory with read mode
records = open("records.txt", "r")

# the num_records variable acts as a counter and therefore, is initially set to 0
num_records = 0

for record in records:
    num_records += 1

# closes records.txt with close()    
records.close()
print(num_records)
```
#### Output:
```Python
5
```
## With statement
"with" statement prevents errors if the file is not closed properly.

Python syntax:
```Python
with open(<file name>, <mode>) as <a name representing the file object>:
    <use the attributes/methods of the named file object to do file hanling operations>
```

#### Write shopping items to a file by using "with" statement and write()
```Python
shopping_list = ["apples", "bananas", "green beans", "turkey"]

with open("shopping_memo.txt", "w") as f:
    for i in range(len(shopping_list)):
        item = shopping_list[i] + "\n"
        f.write(str(i+1) + ": " + item)

with open("shopping_memo.txt", "r") as f:
    lines = f.readlines()
    for line in lines:
        print(line.strip()) # strip() removes "\n"

```
#### The content in shopping_memo_txt after execution:
```Python
1: apples
2: bananas
3: green beans
4: turkey

```

#### Output:
```Python
1: apples
2: bananas
3: green beans
4: turkey

```
