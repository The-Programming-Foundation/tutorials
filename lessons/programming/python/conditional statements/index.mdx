# Conditional Statements
For some problems, we are going to take different actions depending on the conditions. 
For example, take an umbrella when it's raining outside;  otherwise don't need to.

Conditional statements are the instructions we give computers to make decisions and do something accordingly.

There are different kinds of conditional statements.
## 1. if statement:
It has one condition and takes action only when the condition is true. It does not care when the condition is 
not true thus does nothing.
   
For example, 
if a number is equal to the pre-set number:
     output "You won!"

#### Python syntax:
``` 
if condition:
    do something
```
### Python implementation:
```Python
winning_number = 65
num = int(input("Pick a lucky number between 1 and 100: "))

if num == winning_number:
    print("You won!")
```
Output:
```
Pick a lucky number between 1 and 100: 65
You won!
```

## 2. if-else statement:
It takes one action when the condition is true and another action when the condition is false.

For example, a math tutor tells if the answer to a math question is correct or not and displays the correct answer if the answer is incorrect.

#### Python syntax:
```
if condition:
    do something
else:
    do something else
```

### Python implementation:
```Python
answer = int(input("What is the answer of 2 to the power of 8? "))
if answer == 2**8:
    print("Correct")
else:
    print("Incorrect. The answer is ", 2**8)
```
Output:
```
What is the answer of 2 to the power of 8? 64
Incorrect. The answer is  256
```
```
What is the answer of 2 to the power of 8? 256
Correct
```

## 3. if-elif-else statement:
it has more than one condition, and it takes different actions depending on the condition. If all conditions do not match, it does the action of the "else" part.

For example, know the letter grade 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', or 'F' by the score. 
```
90-100 => "A"
80-89 => "B"
70-79 => "C"
60-69 => "D"
below 60 => "F"
```

#### Python syntax
```
if condition:
    action1
elif condition:
    action2
(we can have more 
elif condition: action
)
else:
    other_action
```

### Python implementation:
```Python
score = int(input("Your score(0-100): "))

if score >= 90 and score <= 100:
    print("A")
elif score >= 80 and score < 90:
    print("B")
elif score >= 70 and score < 80:
    print("C")
elif score >= 60 and score < 70:
    print("D")
elif score >= 0 and score < 60:
    print("F")
else:
    print("invalid score")
```
Output:
```
Your score(0-100): 83
B
```

```
Your score(0-100): 59
F
```

```
Your score(0-100): -100
invalid score```
```
 
## 4. Python shorthand if-else:

#### Python syntax:
action1 if condition else action2

### Python implementation
```Python
num1, num2 = 99, 100
print(num1, ">", num2) if num1 > num2 else print(num1, '<=', num2)
```
Output:
```
99 <= 100
```
