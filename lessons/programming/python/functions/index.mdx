# Functions
Functions are known as building blocks of programs. A large problem can be divided into smaller functions, achieving modularity, reusability, and readability.

- Essentially speaking, a function accepts some inputs, performs computations, and outputs the results.
- Functions can be called as many times as we want after they are defined.
- Each function takes only one responsibility and is interdependent
- Functions are logical, modular, and readable to human eyes. With functions as modules, it is easier to maintain the programs further.

## Built-in functions
Built-in functions are pre-defined in and a part of Python languagne. For example, print(), range(), and type().

## User-defined functions
User-defined functions are defined by users. To define a Python function, begin with keyword **def** and follow by a function name.
A function can have zero or some arguments and can return values. Arguments and return values interact with the calling function.

### To define a Python function with no argument and no return value:
```python
# Defining a function
def honk():
    print("Car honks")

# Calling the function
honk()
```

**Output:**
```
Car honks
```

### A Python function with arguments and return value 
```Python
# math_operation has three arguments and returns a value
def math_operation(num1, op, num2):
    return eval(num1 + " " + op + " " + num2)

a, b = input("Enter two numbers: ").split()
op = input("Enter operator: ")
print(math_operation(a, op, b)) 
```


**Output:**
```
Enter two numbers: 25 6
Enter operator: *
150
```
```
Enter two numbers: 99 -10
Enter operator: -
109
```
