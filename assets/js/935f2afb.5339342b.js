The digits 1 and 0 are valued as high and low numbers. While these digits are valued as the output, the decision making element is called the Logic Gates.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"os/kernel/introduction":{"id":"os/kernel/introduction","title":"Kernel","description":"The kernel is the core component of an operating system.
